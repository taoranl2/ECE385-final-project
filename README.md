# Bongo Touch

ZJUI FA2020 ECE385 Final Project 

### Objective
For our Digital Systems Lab final project, I and my partner designed a game named Bongo Touch, which is a 2D percussion music game. 
### Description
In the hardware part, we use System Bus, on-chip-memory, SDRAM in our SoC and implement control modules, music modules, display modules and so on. We use NIOS â…¡ CPU to interface with USB keyboard as we have done in lab 8. In our software part, we modified the C code about USB and IO to accept 4 keycodes input at the same time. The project took about 1 months spending 30 hours a week in total. 
### Technology
 - SystemVerilog for all FPGA module code
 - C for all the driver itnerface code
 - Cyclone IV FPGA chip on which this whole game was presented
