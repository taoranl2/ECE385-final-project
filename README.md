# Bongo Touch

ZJUI FA2020 ECE385 Final Project 

### Objective
For our Digital Systems Lab final project, I and my partner designed a game named Bongo Touch, which is a 2D percussion music game. 
### Description
In the hardware part, we use System Bus, on-chip-memory, SDRAM in our SoC and implement control modules, music modules, display modules and so on. We use NIOS Ⅱ CPU to interface with USB keyboard as we have done in lab 8. In our software part, we modified the C code about USB and IO to accept 4 keycodes input at the same time. The project took about 1 months spending 30 hours a week in total. 
 ### Technology
 - SystemVerilog for all FPGA module code
 - C for all the driver itnerface code
 - Cyclone IV FPGA chip on which this whole game was presented
